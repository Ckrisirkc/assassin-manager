# Things TODO
* - [ ] Work out game loop
  * - [x] Retrieving/Sending texts via email
  * - [ ] Figuring out what kind of framework we should use (Async? Threading? Stack-based?)
* - [ ] Response handler (See: Commands)
* - [ ] Information storage (SQLite? JSON?)
  
  
## Commands
**The response handler has to take commands, much like an irc bot. We also will use those commands to manage the game**  
_Add to this list so we know what we have to implement_  
- [ ] Creating a new game _(ADMIN)_
- [ ] Registering for a game
- [ ] Starting the game _(ADMIN)_
- [ ] Submitting successful kills / Getting new target
  
  
### We have the idea, but there's still some things we need to address.
* How to get people involved
* How to make it easy enough to find/assassinate their target (Ask for their scheduele+picture? If so, how to get this?)
* Should we make smaller games/minigames for people who get assassinated?
