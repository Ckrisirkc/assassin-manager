Things TODO
- New message checking loop
- Response handler
- Information storage

We have the idea, but there's still some things we need to address.
- How to get people involved
- How to make it easy enough to find/assassinate their target (Ask for their scheduele+picture? If so, how to get this?)
- Should we make smaller games/minigames for people who get assassinated?
